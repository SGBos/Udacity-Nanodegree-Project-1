<h2>Movie Trailer Site</h2>

<p>The ec.py file in this repository generates a static html page that
	displays movie posters and plot summaries. Clicking on a movie in the
	page opens a window that displays a short trailer.</p>

<h3>Viewing the Page</h3>

<p>To generate and view the html page, complete the following steps:</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. (If you don't,
		start <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.)</li>
	<li>Clone the repo: <a href="https://github.com/SGBos/Udacity-Nanodegree-Project-1">https://github.com/SGBos/Udacity-Nanodegree-Project-1</a></li>
	<li>Run ec.py on your computer. This will generate a static html page called "fresh_tomatoes.html", and will open
		it in a new browser window.</li>
	<li>Watch some trailers!</li>
</p>

<h3>Attribution</h3>

</p>I wrote ec.py and media.py with guidance from Udacity's Programming Foundations in Python
	course. I modified the fresh_tomatoes.py file that was provided by Udacity. The movie posters come from <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, 
	and the plot descriptions are shortened versions of the ones at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb/a>. 
	The movie title font comes from <a href="http://www.fontsaddict.com/">fontsaddict.com</a>.
